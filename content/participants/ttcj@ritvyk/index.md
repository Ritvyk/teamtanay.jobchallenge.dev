Hi ! I am Ritvik, sometimes people call me "Ricky" and below is my journey have been so far.

### introduction

Hey, I have been into web development for over the past 2 Years , I took the decision of not to become a Software Developer while looking at the trends , and trust me It was the best decision for me. Being an active Web developer I have been into freelancing and worked with companies as an intern to scale up my abilities , I have also contributed to projects on github like "Kiwix Desktop" and "Internet Archive" , I dream big for myself and for it I work hard.

## why are you taking this challenge?

This challenge to me is a best way to check my abilities for web development , I want to know if I just brag about myself or it is true within myself. I want to say truth to myself wheater I can survive in this industry or not with my skill-set and if the answer is "NO" , Then I want to improve myself accordingly. This challenge can channelize this thing for me.

## something interesting about you?

I consider my self as a "Jack Of Trades" , whatever I feel is not for me or seem to be challenging to for me , I would not hesitate to come over to that "Trade/Work" and make myself totally comfortable to it. And one more thing you can find me on Google by "Ritvyk" ;)
### help I need?

Though I consider myself a nice self learner but a channel or medium or a mentor is something that I have been craving for which/who can channelize me and guide me to tackel complex problems in tech.Through this challenge i need help in understanding REACT JS more.
